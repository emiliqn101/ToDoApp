# Django To-Do List

This is my first Django web application, a basic To-Do List. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It's a simple project aimed at learning Django and web development.

Key Features:

    Create tasks.
    Mark tasks as completed.
    Delete tasks.

Please note that completed tasks are not automatically moved to the bottom of the list in this version.

Usage:

    Clone the repository.
    Install Django and required dependencies.
    Run the Django development server.
    Access the app in your web browser.
    Start managing your tasks!

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it as a starting point for your own Django projects.

Enjoy using this simple Django To-Do List app!
