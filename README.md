Project Name: Django To-Do List

Description:

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using Django, a Python web framework. The app allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks with ease. It provides the following features:

    Create Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by entering a task name and clicking the "Add Task" button.

    Update Task Status: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the corresponding checkbox. When a task is completed, it is visually distinguished and moved to the bottom of the list.

    Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.

The app is designed with a user-friendly interface and incorporates AJAX requests for smooth task management without requiring page refreshes. It also includes basic validation to ensure task names are not empty.
